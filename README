DrupalCloud is a library for native Android applications to communicate with Drupal web services.

At the moment, there are two kinds of implementations.

1. JSONServerClient: works for Drupal 6.x with Services 2.x and Key Authentication
2. RESTServerClient: works for Drupal 7.x with Services 3.x and Session Authentication

Setup for development:
1. Import this library to your IDE (Eclipse), and check this project as a library
"Project Properties > Android > (Library) Add"

2. Create your a new project, and configure it to use DrupalCloud library 

Server Required settings:
For RESTServerClient (Drupal 7.x):
/admin/structure/services/list/mobile_commerce/server
Response formatters: json
Request parsing: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 

Testing:
1. Server end: configure your Drupal, Services (endpoints), create a node and so on
2. Put your endpoints configuration into value.xml (see the pattern)
3. Run DrupalCloud project as an Android application
4. If you see the content of your node 1, then you complete the hello world testing.
